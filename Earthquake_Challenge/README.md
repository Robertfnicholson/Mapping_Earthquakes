# Mapping Earthquakes Challenge – 
## Overview of Project

This challenge principally involved developing data visualizations using JavaScript. The purpose of this project 
was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven 
days. My code can be found in the “EarthQuake_Challenge” folder, “static/js/challenge_logic.js”, “index.html,” 
and “static/css/style.css.” </p>

## Project Steps
To complete this project, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical 
coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then I added the data to a map. My approach 
involved the use of JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes 
from the GeoJSON data. I used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and 
created interactivity for the earthquake data. Then I added the tectonic plate data and major earthquake data with 
a similar approach as the earthquake data. Finally, I added functionality that allows the user to display the three 
data sets individually or in different combinations and also added functionality that allows the user to display in
one of three different map views: streets, satellite, and dark. </p>

## Results
The project had three deliverables in which I completed:
*	Deliverable 1: Added Tectonic Plate Data
*	Deliverable 2: Added Major Earthquake Data
*	Deliverable 3: Added an Additional Map.
